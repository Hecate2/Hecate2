### Religious Faith  
Work-life balance is **religiously correct**.  
Efficiency rather than extra worktime is **religiously correct**.  
I accept occasional overtime working, but **NO 996 ALL YEAR ROUND!** Thanks.  
  
**Codes are read by humans**, not machines.  
Testing codes before writing them is OK.  
Save time for humans instead of machines.  
I do not really like Java... unless it does save my time.  
**I need preparation** before I am tested with routine job interview questions.  
**Learn widely and actively.** I am not obligated to be a tool of anyone or any purpose.  
**I can learn** any science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
