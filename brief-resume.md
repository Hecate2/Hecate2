### Religious Faith  

Work-life balance is **religiously correct**.  

Efficiency rather than extra worktime is **religiously correct**.  

I accept occasional overtime working, but **NO 996 ALL YEAR ROUND!** Thanks.  

**Codes are read by humans**, not machines.  

Fully automated tests are **religiously correct**.

Do not write too strict `assert`s in auto tests before the demands are solidified. 

Testing codes before writing them is OK.  

Save time for humans instead of machines.  

**I need preparation** before I am tested with routine job interview questions, especially when it comes to algorithms.  

**Learn widely and actively.** I am not obligated to be a tool of anyone or any purpose. That's why I did not major in computer science or software engineering.  

**I can learn** any science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
